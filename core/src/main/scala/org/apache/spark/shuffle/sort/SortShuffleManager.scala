/**
  * 基于sort的shuffle,进来的记录会依据它们的目标partition id进行排序,然后写入到单个map out 文件中.
  * Reducers连续提取这些文件(map output file)然后以进行读取.万一map output数据量太大,sorted 的部分子集合会被溢出到磁盘,
  * 溢出到磁盘的中间文件可能会非常,但最后会对这些中间文件进行合并,一个task对应一个.
  * 基于sort的shuffle,对于产生对map output file有两种不同对写路径:
  * -序列化排序,当以下三种条件中触发一条便会使用:
  * 1 shuffle dependency 没有指定聚合和输出输出排序;
  * 2 shuffle 序列化支持被序列化值对从定向/迁移;
  * 3 shuffle操作产生小于16777216个输出分区;
  *
  * -反序列化排序:被用于处理所有对cases.
  *
  * -----------------------
  * Serialized sorting mode
  * -----------------------
  * 在序列化排序模式中,进来到记录一旦经过传递到shuffle writer会被序列化,并在排序过程中以序列化的形式进行缓冲.
  * write path有几种优化:
  *   - 排序操作是在二进制而不是Java objects,这会减少内存到开销和GC消耗;
  *   - 它使用专门的缓存高效排序器进行排序.压缩记录指针和partition IDs的数组;
  *   - 溢出合并过程在序列化记录属于同一分区块、不需要反序列化记录;
  *   - 当溢出压缩时,支持及联压缩数据.溢出合并简单的把序列化和溢出分区合并减少最终的输出的分区.这允许高效的数据复制方法,就像nio的transferTo,避免反序列化和copy带来的buffer开销;

/**
 * In sort-based shuffle, incoming records are sorted according to their target partition ids, then
 * written to a single map output file. Reducers fetch contiguous regions of this file in order to
 * read their portion of the map output. In cases where the map output data is too large to fit in
 * memory, sorted subsets of the output can are spilled to disk and those on-disk files are merged
 * to produce the final output file.
 *
 * Sort-based shuffle has two different write paths for producing its map output files:
 *
 *  - Serialized sorting: used when all three of the following conditions hold:
 *    1. The shuffle dependency specifies no aggregation or output ordering.
 *    2. The shuffle serializer supports relocation of serialized values (this is currently
 *       supported by KryoSerializer and Spark SQL's custom serializers).
 *    3. The shuffle produces fewer than 16777216 output partitions.
 *  - Deserialized sorting: used to handle all other cases.
 *
 * -----------------------
 * Serialized sorting mode
 * -----------------------
 *
 * In the serialized sorting mode, incoming records are serialized as soon as they are passed to the
 * shuffle writer and are buffered in a serialized form during sorting. This write path implements
 * several optimizations:
 *
 *  - Its sort operates on serialized binary data rather than Java objects, which reduces memory
 *    consumption and GC overheads. This optimization requires the record serializer to have certain
 *    properties to allow serialized records to be re-ordered without requiring deserialization.
 *    See SPARK-4550, where this optimization was first proposed and implemented, for more details.
 *
 *  - It uses a specialized cache-efficient sorter ([[ShuffleExternalSorter]]) that sorts
 *    arrays of compressed record pointers and partition ids. By using only 8 bytes of space per
 *    record in the sorting array, this fits more of the array into cache.
 *
 *  - The spill merging procedure operates on blocks of serialized records that belong to the same
 *    partition and does not need to deserialize records during the merge.
 *
 *  - When the spill compression codec supports concatenation of compressed data, the spill merge
 *    simply concatenates the serialized and compressed spill partitions to produce the final output
 *    partition.  This allows efficient data copying methods, like NIO's `transferTo`, to be used
 *    and avoids the need to allocate decompression or copying buffers during the merge.
 *
 * For more details on these optimizations, see SPARK-7081.
